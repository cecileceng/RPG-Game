Obligatory Disclaimer:
The purpose of designing this game with this theme is for learning/demonstation purposes only. The artwork is from Eldritch Horror, which is not owned by me. Artwork from the Fantasy Flight website mostly. Also, the song playing is not mine either. (Licht und Schatten by Yutaka Yamada for the Tokyo Ghoul soundtrack) I made/make $0 on this, so please don't sue.
